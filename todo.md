# ToDo

## Right Now

- allow deletion of collection
- allow imprt in cards view to show imported cards
- ask for deletion fo cards on deletion f collection
- implement radios in add form
- form width auf desktop min width setzen

- make input darks (selected, when text was last input

- select other collection names liek text

- add notes function in learning view
- auf collections seite buttons unten rechts: import, export, delete, edit
  - only allow selection of one

remove collection mentions on remove -> just iterate through all collections and remove cardids of not exisitng cards? use bridge table?

## Later

- "spaced repetition"

- refactor forms handling to allow escape to cancel
- import cards functionality (using zod as validation)
  - export and import not only exports the cards, but also a collection having all of the card ids
  - request name of collection on export

- save practices history
  - also show stats like in practice comp
