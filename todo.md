# ToDo

## Right Now

- show popup after import

- export ids with collections to prevent double exports

- export and import leads to double IDs -> fix somehow
- import cards functionality (using zod as validation)
  - export and import not only exports the cards, but also a collection having all of the card ids

## Later

- rename to learn with me (github, config, everything)
- unify naming of components (.comp vs -comp)
- fix place where import export methods are put: some in store, some in utils, some in components
- empty states

- refactor forms handling to allow escape to cancel
- prohibit scroll on open modal
- form width auf desktop min width setzen

- save practices history
  - "spaced repetition"
  - show last practice times in collection view
  - also show stats like in practice comp

- add notes function in learning view
