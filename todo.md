# ToDo

## Right Now

- filter current cards form input, not put them in system prompt
- words and phrases call always seperate
  - words call: filter words from input (also convert phrase to words to filter)
  - when both: create phrases, then filter output + current from input to generate words
- form width auf desktop min width setzen -> use the page wrapper logic?
- fix prompts to be more precise

## Later

- show popup after import
- add 'every word' mode for notes and stuff
- refactor forms handling to allow escape to cancel
- prohibit scroll on open modal
- theme toggle

- animations! -> angular 20.2 bring them back woop woop
- add notes function in learning view
- save practices history
  - "spaced repetition"
  - show last practice times in collection view
  - also show stats like in practice comp
